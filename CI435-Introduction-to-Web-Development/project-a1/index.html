              This week was our introduction to the course, Computer Science for
              Games, with multiple modules being introduced with various
              assignments. Of these, the Game Design & Development Course is
              definitely the most interesting to me because of the application
              of knowledge it requires:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learning how games work</li>
              <li>Learning the theory behind 'fun'</li>
              <li>Implementing these ideas in a way that creates fun</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Overall, I'm also very interested with how the course is going.
              Additionally, I've been putting some time into learning Rust, a
              low-level language similar to C or C++, with an amazing compiler
              that enforces safe-practices. I think that having knowledge in a
              more complex language, when compared with Javascript and Python,
              where I'm more experienced, will be a big benefit going forward.
              Having the knowledge of how to write safe and fast code is a big
              positive in my view.

            <h1>LaTeX Setup</h1>
            <hr />
            <h5 class="text-muted">Date written: 2020-10-18</h5>

          <p>
            The highlight of this week involved setting up LaTeX for my Game
            Design and Development essay. LaTeX is a set of additions to the TeX
            typesetting system, which allows you to compile documents out of
            plaintext files. This can be especially useful for essays and
            articles, as the compiler handles all of the layout and styling.
            Much like HTML, LaTeX can be utilised to effectively structure
            documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setting up LaTeX on Linux, specifically a Debian distribution, is
            fairly easy, as it just involves installing some packages. Finding
            the right packages to do what you want to do is the tricky bit.
            Starting out with installing
            <span class="text-monospace">texlive</span> with
            <span class="text-monospace">apt</span> is the best bet. This
            package allows you to utilise the core of TeX.
          </p>

          <ul class="terminal-ul">
            <li>sudo apt install texlive</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This installs the majority of what's needed to use LaTeX, inculding
            the
            <span class="text-monospace">pdflatex</span> command. This is a
            standard compiler for LaTeX. What's missing from this is the
            BibLaTeX package, which is required for proper handling of the
            bibliography. As my essay needs to have proper citations, I'll be
            using BibLaTeX to implement this functionality.
          </p>

          <ul class="terminal-ul">
            <li>sudo apt install biber</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This commant installs <span class="text-monospace">biber</span>,
            which is a processing backend for LaTeX that additionally provides
            the BibLaTeX package for use with
            <span class="text-monospace">pdflatex</span>. Using this, I can
            generate and utilise bibliographies, and have LaTeX and BibLaTeX
            handle the document layout.
          </p>

          <p>
            LaTeX is useful for someone like me as it allows for me to
            effectively program what I want without worrying about layout.
            Whereas software like Word can create documents that look right,
            getting them to look correct takes a lot of time and effort. Having
            LaTeX handle it for me can speed up my workflow by a huge amount.
            Additionally, BibLaTeX is one of my favourite things in the document
            preparation ecosystem.

          <img
            src="image/df8s7908.jpg"
            alt="An image of my desktop running Linux"
          />

          <p>
            The 22nd of October marked a special day in the realm of Linux;
            Ubuntu finalised and launcher their 20.10 release, following on from
            version 20.04. This is a short-term release, indicating that it'll
            be supported for 9 months, unlike 20.04, which gets 5 years of
            support as an LTS release. I prefer rolling releases with operating
            systems, as I prefer to stay on the bleeding edge as much as
            possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            This launch involved numerous updates to the packages provided by
            Ubuntu, including Gnome 3.38, bringing with it numerous bug fixes
            and improvement, a few of which are very important to me.
            Additionally, the Linux 5.8 kernel is included, bringing with it
            better driver support, including native exFAT drivers and all the
            improvements from kernels 5.5 to 5.7.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since LTS builds of Ubuntu specialise on stability, there's a long
            time period between a release of each build and the so-called
            "feature freeze". This is because Canonical spend a long time making
            sure that the packages are all stable and work together, and as such
            have a deadline for packages to be submitted. Otherwise, they'd end
            up optimising packages forever and never reaching a stable build.
          </p>
          <p>
            A by-product of this is that packages end up many versions out of
            date, including the kernel. This is significant as sometimes newer
            devices may only function with a newer kernel. This is relevant
            because of how STR (short term release) builds have a shorter window
            which, while increasing instability somewhat, also means that the
            package versions are much closer to bleeding-edge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the features I love the most come from Gnome 3.38, including
            better support for multiple displays with differing refresh rates
            (improving upon a prior issue where it'll sync to the lowest refresh
            rate possible), and fixing an issue where the wallpaper appears
            blurry due to an OpenGL issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, I spent some time customising a GTK theme and applying
            it to my desktop. Using Linux makes desktop customisation much
            easier, which makes it very enjoyable to use for me (on top of the
            benefits in software).
          </p>
